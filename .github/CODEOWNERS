# CODEOWNERS file
#
# This file is used to describe who maintains what template in this repository.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: in order to actually get pinged, commit access is required.
# This also holds true for GitHub teams. Since almost none of our teams have
# write permissions, you need to list all members of the team with commit
# access individually.
#
# For documentation on this file, see
# https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/
#
# Mentioned users will get code review requests.
